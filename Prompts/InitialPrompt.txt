Prompt:

I’m planning to build a full-stack web application called StudyRoom, which will allow students to create and join virtual study rooms, chat in real time, and collaborate.

The tech stack is:

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js + Express.js + Socket.io

Database: MySQL (using mysql2 or Sequelize)

Auth: JWT-based authentication

I want you to explain the approach to starting this project as a professional software engineer — not to write all the code for me.

Specifically, I want a step-by-step breakdown that covers:

Project structure and folder layout

Should I keep frontend and backend in the same repository?

How should files and directories be organized for scalability?

Environment setup

What dependencies need to be installed for each layer?

How do I safely handle environment variables for local vs production (using .env)?

How should I connect Node/Express to a MySQL database securely?

Backend architecture

What are the key modules or layers I should implement (routes, controllers, models, middleware)?

How should I design REST endpoints for user authentication, room creation/joining, and chat messages?

How should real-time chat be integrated with Socket.io in this context?

Frontend architecture

What are the essential React components and pages I’ll need?

How should I organize the frontend to connect with the backend (Axios, Context API, etc.)?

How do I structure UI state for rooms, chat messages, and authentication?

Communication between frontend and backend

How do I set up CORS and environment variables for API URLs?

What’s the recommended local development flow to run both servers together (e.g., concurrently)?

Database design

What tables and relationships make sense for users, rooms, and messages?

Should I manage schema manually with SQL, or use an ORM like Sequelize or Prisma?

Professional workflow practices

How do professionals handle Git version control and .gitignore setup in full-stack repos?

What kind of README documentation should accompany a project like this?

How should I prepare the project for deployment later (Render, Vercel, Railway, etc.)?

In your response, focus on reasoning, structure, and setup steps, not full code implementation.

I want to understand how everything should be done and in what order, like a senior engineer would plan before writing any code.

Please present the answer in clear sections and chronological order.
